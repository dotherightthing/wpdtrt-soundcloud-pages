# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

A best-practice boilerplate for plugin development.

## Installation

### A. Create the plugin folder

1. Clone this repository to your WordPress plugins folder
1. Rename `generator-wp-plugin-boilerplate` to `your-plugin-name` (this should be less than 50 characters, for compatibility with Bower)
1. Then launch Terminal from this folder

### B. Install requirements

1. Node & NPM: <https://nodejs.org/>
1. Git: <https://git-scm.com/>
1. [Bower](http://bower.io/): `$ npm install -g bower`
1. Composer: <https://getcomposer.org/download/>
1. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/): `$ sudo npm install -g yo`

### C. Set Defaults (optional)

Edit `.yo-rc.json`, to substitute in your own values.

These will then become the defaults when running the Yeoman generator (`yo`).

### D. Scaffold project

```
npm install

sudo npm link

yo wp-plugin-boilerplate
```

When you encounter the following prompts, hit ENTER to confirm that it's ok to copy over the replacement files:

```
conflict package.json
? Overwrite package.json? (Ynaxdh)
```

```
conflict .gitignore
? Overwrite .gitignore? (Ynaxdh)
```

## Notes

### Testing

There aren't any tests yet, but these are on the roadmap.

PHPUnit is currently at version 6.1, but this project uses the Old Stable Release of 5.7 to work with PHP 5.6. This version is supported until February 2018, see https://phpunit.de/.

### Publishing

The plugin name should not include the word 'plugin'

#### `readme.txt`

The headings correspond to the horizontal tabs that display on a plugin detail page on <http://wordpress.org/plugins>:

* Description
* Installation
* FAQ
* Screenshots
* Changelog

The remaining tabs are dynamically generated by WordPress.org:

* Stats
* Support
* Reviews
* Developers

### Translation

`.pot` files can be generated using the [WordPress i18n tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/#wordpress-i18n-tools)
